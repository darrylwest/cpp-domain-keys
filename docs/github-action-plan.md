# GitHub Action Plan for Domain Keys C++23 Library

 Workflow Structure

 - Target: Ubuntu 24.10 with GCC 14.2.0
 - Trigger: Push to main, PRs, manual dispatch
 - Build: CMake-based with C++23 standard
 - Test: Catch2 unit tests execution

 Key Challenges to Address

 1. Ubuntu 24.10 Availability: Check if GitHub Actions supports Ubuntu 24.10 runners (may need Docker alternative)
 2. GCC 14.2.0: Ensure specific GCC version installation or use appropriate toolchain
 3. Catch2 Dependency: Handle Catch2 v3 installation via package manager or vcpkg
 4. C++23 Support: Verify compiler flags and standard library compatibility

 Workflow Steps

 1. Checkout code
 2. Setup Ubuntu 24.10 environment (or Docker container)
 3. Install GCC 14.2.0 and dependencies
 4. Install Catch2 v3
 5. Configure CMake build
 6. Build static library
 7. Run unit tests
 8. Upload build artifacts

 Build Matrix Options

 - Release/Debug configurations
 - Potentially test with different GCC versions for compatibility

## Build.yml

**Key Features:**

  - Ubuntu 24.04 (closest available to 24.10)
  - GCC 14.2.0 installation via apt
  - C++23 standard enforcement
  - Build matrix for Release/Debug configurations
  - Catch2 dependency handling
  - Parallel builds with ninja
  - Test execution with ctest
  - Example validation
  - Artifact upload for Release builds

Workflow triggers: Push to main/develop, PRs, manual dispatch

The workflow addresses the challenge that Ubuntu 24.10 isn't available in GitHub Actions by using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with GCC 14.2.0, which provides the same target compilation environment.
